# Final Analysis and Overview

This research project dives into the relationship that various factors have on COVID-19 death rates across the United States. The primary focus is looking at the impact of Emergency Department concentration as it relates to COVID-19 deaths. To determine the significance of this relationship, we reviewed other potentially impactful demographic measurements as they relate to death rates as well. Below you find a brief overview of our findings and within this repository, you will find the source data and well as code used to evaluate these pairings. There are additionally images of the plots used to visualize the analysis that were generated and saved to the repository when running the code.

### COVID-19 and ED Concentration
Posed Question: Is there a relationship between Emergency department (ED) concentration and COVID-19 death rates?

Response: The r-value of the Covid-19 death rates and EDs per capita suggests a weak inverse relationship. The calculated r-value is -0.46.

### COVID-19 and Poverty Rate
Posed Question: Is the Emergency Department and COVID-19 relationship stronger than poverty rate?

Response: With an r-value of -0.5, there is a weak inverse relationship between COVID-19 death rates and poverty rates. This is a 0.41 difference which suggests it is not a stronger relationship than to Emergency Department concentration.

### COVID-19 and Age
Posed Question: Is the Emergency Department and COVID-19 relationship stronger than median age?

Response: An r-value of 0.29 suggests a weak relationship between COVID-19 death rates and median age. This suggesting a possible stronger correlation although still weak.
